==== Properties ====
  * Good all-rounder
  * What's it like? [[WP>LEGO]]
  * Softens and dissolves in acetone
  * Needs heated bed
  * Temperature range: 200ºC-250ºC depending on brand.
  * Hygroscopic: keep sealed with [[Storing filament|dessicants]], eg. silica gel
  * Typically lower tensile strength than [[PLA]], but far less brittle.
  * Shrinks significantly, so not dimensionally stable.

=== Typical physical properties ===
  * Density: 1.03 g/cm³, ie. ≈2.5 grams/metre (1.75mm filament)
  * Melting point: 145-160ºC
  * Melt temperature: 210±8ºC

==== Availability ====

  * Widely available
  * Also available on officially-supported Robox Reel direct from CEL: [[http://robox.cel-uk.com/filament/abs-filament.html]]

==== Hints and Tips ====
  * [[Storing filament|Keep it dry and sealed when not in use.]]

==== Print profiles and tweaks ====
  * Standard Robox profiles

==== Safety ====
  * Debatable / controversial.  Regardless, probably not the best choice as a variety of joss-stick or dessert topping.
  * Produces light fumes when being printed. Still undefined how much harm this causes to humans but if you want to play it safe do try to have some ventilation to avoid breathing them. Cel has talked about adding a carbon filter to the printer to minimize this potential health hazard.
