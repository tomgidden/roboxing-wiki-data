====== Calibrate Nozzle Height ======

At the moment, this is a tricky procedure to explain, and CEL are working on a better process, or at least a better explanation.

The purpose of this routine is twofold:

  - It determines the difference in height above the bed of the two nozzles when activated;
  - It calibrates the [[Z limit sensor]], which Robox uses to detect when the nozzles are touching the bed.

**Both calibrations are done with the PEI [[printing surface]] removed from the print bed.**  This is so the calibration is done against the firm surface of the metal bed rather than the flexible PEI sheet that may bend or spring, affecting the calibration.

==== Difference in nozzle height ====

To detect the difference in height, Robox will alternate between the two nozzles, touching them against the bed.  It doesn't care how far each nozzle is from the bed, but just the difference in how far each nozzle is from the bed.  It alternates between them and takes an average.

==== Z limit sensor calibration ====

Robox's head is supported mainly by the bottom gantry bar which it can pivot on, tipping forward to touch the bed. It is limited by touching against the top gantry bar.

As the gantry lowers and the head touches the bed, the head is pushed upwards, pivoting on the bottom gantry bar.  This reduces the pressure the head has on the top gantry bar, as the base is supporting the weight of the head rather than the top gantry bar.

There is a sensor in the head, visible in the centre of the black plastic gantry holder directly behind the top bar.  This is the [[Z limit sensor]].

This part of the operation calibrates this sensor:  it determines at what point the nozzle is considered to be touching.  As a result, it doesn't matter how far the nozzle is from the base, but how much upwards force is being applied to the nozzle by the bed.

==== How to calibrate it well ====
The aim is to pick the setting where the upward force is as low as possible but still above zero.

To do this, any flat, smooth, even and non-compressible sheet can be used.  A sheet of quality printer/copier paper works, but make sure the heat of the bed doesn't curl the paper: if the paper isn't flat, it's harder to sense when the nozzle isn't pressing down.

Adjust the nozzle height using the "Too tight" button until the paper moves freely under the nozzle while still touching it. Then press "Too tight" again as few times as possible so the paper moves without the nozzle touching it at all: such that pressing "Too tight" any more would make no difference. Then press "Too loose" once so you can feel the nozzle scrape very lightly against the paper surface as it moves.

Basically find the boundary between non-touching and touching, and set the nozzle one step on the tight side of that boundary.

That should be the highest the nozzle can be while still touching the paper.

  * //This is still quite subjective. I'd appreciate it if an experienced Robox user can confirm.  --[[user:gid|@gid]]//

  * //I think it is really accurate for a starting position. Then move on to the actual print calibration I added below and it should be good.  --[[user:bhudson|@bhudson]]//

  * //To get the sheet perfectly flat, it may be useful if the sheet is big enough to spread it with two fingers across the print-bed or use both hands to do so when sliding it under the nozzle, just make sure not to apply too much pressure otherwise you may be pushing the entire bed down which could yield faulty calibration results. --[[user:mistsoul|@mistsoul]]//

  * //I'm not sure I agree with @mistsoul's suggestion here, as a larger sheet being pushed down will move far less easily, so it will be harder to detect when the nozzle is touching.  --[[user:gid|@gid]]//

  * //If your bed is moving down during this process, you are pushing too hard or your bed is broken. The bed should be fully supported for this step and since you are pressing in the center of the bed it should not move at all. It takes only gentle pressure to move the paper back and forth. --[[user:bhudson|@bhudson]]//

First-Print Nozzle Height Calibration

After you complete the three Robox head calibration steps, this additional calibration step will refine the nozzle settings to make sure you have optimal positioning for the nozzles to get the best first-layer adhesion.

Open the Head tab in the Advanced section of AutoMaker. Write down the Z values for both nozzles.
Select a simple print. The Roboxâ„¢ cube works well or a simple cube or cylinder will be fine, though right-angles work best.
Print only the first layer of this print with the Draft profile. You really only need part of the first layer but don't let the second layer start. Cancel the print before the second layer starts. Remove the print from the bed.
Repeat the print with the Fine profile, again stopping before the second layer is deposited. Remove the print from the bed.
Examine the first layer result. You are looking for two qualities:
The extrusion paths expand to meet each other so the first layer is one unbroken sheet of plastic.
The nozzle is not rubbing on the first layer enough to create troughs or depressions in the first layer. If there are traces or bubbles of plastic on the nozzle, it is rubbing.
Adjust the Z value of the nozzle up or down by .05 increments. If you see gaps between extrusion paths, adjust down. If the nozzle is rubbing, adjust up. Don't forget to write the new values to the head.
Repeat until the two qualities above are evident. The ideal first later will be unbroken and will be slightly wavy on a path perpendicular to the path of nozzle travel. For PLA, it is usually better to err slightly low; for PET it is better to err slightly high.
==== How it's used ====

The routine that actually tests how high the nozzle is above the print bed is done at the start of each print ("[[North-South-East-West calibration]]"), and also in the "[[Level Gantry]]" operation:  it uses the setting here to probe the PEI [[printing surface]] with the nozzle and detect at what height(s) the nozzle is touching the bed.  By checking at multiple locations, it can determine if the bed is level and compensate accordingly.

==== Completion ====

Once the calibration is complete, the setting is stored in the head.  __It is a property of the head itself, although removing the head will require re-calibration as the head location may have moved.__ //[-- Is this correct?  --[[user:gid|@gid]]]//

Both steps of the calibration routine affect the "Z" parameters in the Head's details.

After calibration, the values can be manually changed by selecting [[Calibrate Nozzle Height]] and selecting "Adjust Offset Values" rather than "Recalibrate".
