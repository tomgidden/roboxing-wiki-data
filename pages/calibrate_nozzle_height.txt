====== Calibrate Nozzle Height ======

At the moment, this is a tricky procedure to explain, and CEL are working on a better process, or at least a better explanation.

The purpose of this routine is twofold:

  - It determines the difference in height above the bed of the two nozzles when activated;
  - It calibrates the [[Z limit sensor]], which Robox uses to detect when the nozzles are touching the bed.

**Both calibrations are done with the PEI [[printing surface]] removed from the print bed.**  This is so the calibration is done against the firm surface of the metal bed rather than the flexible PEI sheet that may bend or spring, affecting the calibration.

==== Difference in nozzle height ====

To detect the difference in height, Robox will alternate between the two nozzles, touching them against the bed.  It doesn't care how far each nozzle is from the bed, but just the difference in how far each nozzle is from the bed.  It alternates between them and takes an average.

==== Z limit sensor calibration ====

Robox's head is supported mainly by the bottom gantry bar which it can pivot on, tipping forward to touch the bed. It is limited by touching against the top gantry bar.

As the gantry lowers and the head touches the bed, the head is pushed upwards, pivoting on the bottom gantry bar.  This reduces the pressure the head has on the top gantry bar, as the base is supporting the weight of the head rather than the top gantry bar.

There is a sensor in the head, visible in the centre of the black plastic gantry holder directly behind the top bar.  This is the [[Z limit sensor]].

This part of the operation calibrates this sensor:  it determines at what point the nozzle is considered to be touching.  As a result, it doesn't matter how far the nozzle is from the base, but how much upwards force is being applied to the nozzle by the bed.

==== How to calibrate it well ====
The aim is to pick the setting where the upward force is as low as possible but still above zero.

To do this, any flat, smooth, even and non-compressible sheet can be used.  A sheet of quality printer/copier paper works, but make sure the heat of the bed doesn't curl the paper: if the paper isn't flat, it's harder to sense when the nozzle isn't pressing down.

__Adjust the nozzle height using the "Too tight" button until the paper moves freely under the nozzle while still touching it. Then press "Too tight" again as few times as possible so the paper moves without the nozzle touching it at all: such that pressing "Too tight" any more would make no difference. Then press "Too loose" once so you can feel the nozzle scrape very lightly against the paper surface as it moves.__

__Basically find the boundary between non-touching and touching, and set the nozzle one step on the tight side of that boundary.__

__That should be the highest the nozzle can be while still touching the paper.__

//[ This is still quite subjective. I've underlined parts that I'm not totally sure about, and would appreciate it if an experienced Robox user can confirm.  --[[user:gid|@gid]] ]//

  * //To get the sheet perfectly flat, it may be useful if the sheet is big enough to spread it with two fingers across the print-bed or use both hands to do so when sliding it under the nozzle, just make sure not to apply too much pressure otherwise you may be pushing the entire bed down which could yield faulty calibration results. --[[user:mistsoul|@mistsoul]]//

  * //I'm not sure I agree with @mistsoul's suggestion here, as a larger sheet being pushed down will move far less easily, so it will be harder to detect when the nozzle is touching.  --[[user:gid|@gid]]//

==== How it's used ====

The routine that actually tests how high the nozzle is above the print bed is done at the start of each print ("[[North-South-East-West calibration]]"), and also in the "[[Level Gantry]]" operation:  it uses the setting here to probe the PEI [[printing surface]] with the nozzle and detect at what height(s) the nozzle is touching the bed.  By checking at multiple locations, it can determine if the bed is level and compensate accordingly.

==== Completion ====

Once the calibration is complete, the setting is stored in the head.  __It is a property of the head itself, although removing the head will require re-calibration as the head location may have moved.__ //[-- Is this correct?  --[[user:gid|@gid]]]//

Both steps of the calibration routine affect the "Z" parameters in the Head's details.

After calibration, the values can be manually changed by selecting [[Calibrate Nozzle Height]] and selecting "Adjust Offset Values" rather than "Recalibrate".
