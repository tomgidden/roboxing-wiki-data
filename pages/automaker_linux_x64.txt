  * Install Java 1.8 (last update sept 2014, is subject to change)
  * Download Automaker for Linux X64
  * Check your Grafic drivers, it is recommended to use factory drivers, not the auto-installed generic drivers.
  * copy your AutoMakerxxxxxx.x64-installer.run file to the installation map. (/home, I prefer /opt)
  * make your AutoMakerxxxxxx.x64-installer.run executable
  * run the installer
  * download GraphicsOverrideLinux.zip and extract GraphicsOverrideLinux.sh.
  * make GraphicsOverrideLinux.sh executable
  * open a Terminal and run this script.

If all goes well, you will find in your install map CEL/AutoMaker/Automaker.run
