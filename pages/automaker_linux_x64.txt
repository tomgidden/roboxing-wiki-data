==== Installation for Debian-based distributions ====

If you are using a distribution based on Debian (like Debian Wheezy or Ubuntu 14), AutoMaker may be unable to properly detect the Robox printer when launched by a non-root user. This is because the way it detects the Robox depends on the "udevadm" command, but that command is only available to the root user in Debian.

=== Using a pre-made package ===

This is a very simple package that tries to make things a little easier for you.

First, download the package from [[https://cloud.ailesse.info/public.php?service=files&t=fdd4319f2a50606cf075bb56b3ebb401|here]], and install it as root with:
<code>dpkg -i robox-support_1.0-1_all.deb</code>

Then, in the directory where you installed Automaker (normally ~/CEL), delete (or move away) ''Common/bin/RoboxDetector.linux.sh'' and replace it by a symbolic link to ''/usr/bin/robox-detect'' :
<code>cd ~/CEL/Common/bin
mv RoboxDetector.linux.sh RoboxDetector.linux.sh.orig
ln -s /usr/bin/robox-detect RoboxDetector.linux.sh
</code>

Add your user account to the ''dialup'' group with the following command as root (and of course replacing //username// by your own user name!):
<code> adduser username dialup</code>

Unplug the Robox from the computer, log off, log back in and replug the Robox. AutoMaker should now be able to detect it.

=== Without using a package ===

To solve that issue, we'll first give a proper device name to the Robox printer, so that it is easier to find. As root, create the file ''/etc/udev/rules.d/80-robox.rules'' and add the following line inside it:

<code>SUBSYSTEM=="tty", SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="16d0", ATTRS{idProduct}=="081b", ATTRS{product}=="Robox", SYMLINK+="robox%n"</code>

Unplug and replug the Robox to the computer. A new file called ''/dev/robox0'' should now appear (actually, it is a symbolic link to the real device node - usually ''/dev/ttyACM0''). If it doesn't, try rebooting the computer to ensure that the new udev rules were properly taken into account.

Now, in the directory where you installed Automaker (normally ~/CEL), edit ''Common/bin/RoboxDetector.linux.sh'' and replace its content by the following:

<code>#!/bin/bash
# Note - both the id and name parameters are unused here.
for device in /dev/robox*
do
    name=$1
    id=$2
    if [[ $device = "/dev/robox*" ]] 
    then 
        echo NOT_CONNECTED 
        exit 
    fi 
    echo $device >/dev/stdout 
    echo " " 
done</code>

Add your user account to the ''dialup'' group with the following command as root (and of course replacing //username// by your own user name!):
<code> adduser username dialup</code>

Log off, and log back in. AutoMaker should now be able to detect your Robox printer.
