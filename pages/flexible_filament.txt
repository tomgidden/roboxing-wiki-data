==== Status ====

@magelan and others have tried [[NinjaFlex]] flexible filament and have been unsuccessful, apparently due to the convoluted feed path and Bowden tube arrangement when combined with a soft and high-friction filament.

@BHudson has considered options for either a replacement drive/extruder at the head to pull filament rather than push; or an auxiliary drive at the head to supplement the push from the main extruder.

CEL have ordered some flexible filament ([[NinjaFlex]]) for experimentation.
