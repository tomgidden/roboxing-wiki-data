====== Settings: Filament multiplier ======

    * Default setting: ?

===== Description =====
Filament multiplier compensates for the compressibility of the filament in use, which may result in an effective change in diameter as it is compressed and pushed through the extruder.

A perfectly hard filament will probably use a multiplier of 1.00.
