====== Settings: Feed rate multiplier ======

    * Default setting: ?

===== Description =====

This adjusts the extrusion rate of the material: setting it to 2 will double the amount of filament extruded.

Simply put, the extruder should push enough filament to the head so that it the same length of filament comes out of the nozzle as distance the head travels.

Typically, this value would be 1.00.
