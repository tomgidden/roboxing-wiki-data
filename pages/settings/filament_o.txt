===== Description =====
The diameter of the filament used.

Currently, 1.75mm for Robox, but you can use digital calipers to enter a more precise figure.

Nowadays, adequate digital calipers are cheap and easy to obtain: US $10 or £8 can get you digital calipers with 0.1mm accuracy.  These can also be useful for measuring objects for 3D modelling (along with digital angle finders) so it's not a bad idea to get som.
