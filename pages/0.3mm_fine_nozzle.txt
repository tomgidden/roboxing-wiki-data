====== 0.3mm (fine) nozzle ======
(a.k.a "T0 nozzle", "fine nozzle")

The left-side nozzle (when viewed from the front of Robox) is finer than many other printers of similar class, with a diameter of 0.3mm.  In addition, the [[needle valve]] may be used to reduce the effective diameter even further.  It is used to create the detailed exterior of models, and in some print modes it is used exclusively at the expense of speed.

Other printers compromise by using a single nozzle of 0.4mm diameter or higher, relying on it to be fine enough for detail, yet coarse enough for reliability and speed.

When detail matters less, Robox uses the [[0.8mm fill nozzle]] for performance, where required for strength and adhesion.
