====== 0.8mm (fill) nozzle ======

The right-side nozzle (when viewed from the front of Robox) is coarser than many other printers of similar class, with a diameter of 0.8mm.  It is used to fill the inside of models quickly in some print modes, as well as laying down the first layer with some materials that may have more difficulty sticking to the PEI-based [[print bed]].  It is also used exclusively when printing a model in "[[Draft mode]]".

Other printers compromise by using a single nozzle of 0.4mm diameter or higher, relying on it to be fine enough for detail, yet coarse enough for reliability and speed.

For detailed work, Robox uses the [[0.3mm fine nozzle]].
