===== About this model =====

The Twisted Bottle was suggested by @Restart as a good test model as StrataSys send it out as samples of their printers' output: [[http://www.cel-robox.com/forums/topic/standard-test-sample/]]

The "original" model: [[http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12278]]

There is another version of the bottle with more uniform walls that may print better:  [[http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:80880]]
