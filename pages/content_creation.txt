====== Content Creation ======

While you can download and print [[Things|existing content]], creating new 3D content for printing is one of the most complex tasks, and probably not within the scope of this site.

There are a number of approaches, including CAD; manual modelling; mathematical formulation; scientific data-set gathering/generation; and 3D scanning.  The particular requirements and capabilities of the user will determine which technique to use.

Manual modelling is where the user will interactively construct the object(s) using a 3D view.  It's time consuming and takes time, patience and skill to learn how to do it well.

The best 3D modelling packages are very expensive, and even the lower-end applications can cost more than the Robox itself.  However, there are a few freely-available options that are worth considering.  The commercial packages often see educational licenses for a reduced price, but unfortunately they rarely offer such deals to hobbyists anymore.

=== Freely available / Open-source ===

     * Blender: [[http://www.blender.org|Blender]];   A full-featured 3D editing system.  It's fairly complex to learn, but for the purpose of 3D Printing, only a small part needs to be learned, as the complex animation, surface/material/texture, and rendering capabilities are of no use.  There is a standard Export add-on available for exporting STL files, as well as a more useful 3D Printing add-on with various validation and export tools.  [[Using Blender with Robox]]

     * OpenSCAD: [[http://www.openscad.org|OpenSCAD]];   This package appeals to programmers, as it allows the user to describe the object in code form.
