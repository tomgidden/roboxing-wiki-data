====== B Axis Stuck ======

Robox uses the usual three cartesian axes, X, Y and Z, as well as three "pseudo"-axes:

X: Head left/right
Y: Bed forward/backward
Z: Head up/down
E: Extruder 1 forward/backward
D: Extruder 2 forward/backward (not currently used)
B: Nozzle control

The nozzle control motor is used to both switch the nozzle in use, and also to open and close the nozzle valves.  The B axis ranges from "[[0.3mm (fine) nozzle|fine nozzle]] selected and fully open" (around -5), to "fine nozzle selected and closed" (around -1.1, depending on calibration), to "[[0.8mm (fill) nozzle|fill nozzle]] selected and closed" (around 1.1, depending on calibration), to "fill nozzle selected and fully open" (around 5).

Apparently there are a number of different reasons B axis might stick, so itâ€™s not a symptom that can be diagnosed in isolation. 

One possible cause is lack of lithium grease on the cam post within the head and there is an article on how to [[https://robox.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/1000077303-head|dismantle the head]]
