Robox uses the usual three axises x, y and z.  The x axis is the left and right movement of the print head as viewed from the front of the machine.  The y axis is the movement of the print head forward and backwards as viewed from the front.  The z axis is the vertical movement of the print head. Besides these three axises there is also a 'B axis'.  This axis is within the print head and is where the two nozzles swivel about an axis that is parallel to the y axis.  The reason for this movement is to move one of the print nozzles into play.

The B axis stuck error appears on some machines.  One possible cause is lack of lithium grease on the cam post within the head and there is an article on how to [[https://robox.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/1000077303-head|dismantle the head]]
