====== Using Blender with Robox ======

[[http://blender.org]]

Blender is a full-featured 3D editing system, freely available to all users.

It's fairly complex to learn, but for the purpose of 3D Printing, only a small part needs to be learned, as the complex animation, surface/material/texture, and rendering capabilities can be ignored.

There is a standard Export add-on available for exporting STL files, as well as a more useful [[http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Extensions:2.6/Py/Scripts/Modeling/PrintToolbox|3D Printing Toolbox]] with various validation and export tools.  Both of these can be enabled in the ''Add-ons'' tab of the ''User Preferences'' (under the ''File'' menu).

(To be added:  need to determine best arrangement of Blender units to match Robox scaling)
