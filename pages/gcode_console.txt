====== The GCode console ======

AutoMaker allows the user to send low-level commands to the Robox, called "GCode".  This de-facto standard instruction language has been used in industry to control manufacturing equipment since the 1950s, and is used by most 3D printers.

To access the GCode console in AutoMaker, from the status screen (showing the Robox) find the three small circles between the left-side panel and the main Robox display. Click there, and the [[Advanced tray]] should appear.  The bottom half of this tray, a white box with a small text field and a button "Send GCode", is the GCode console.

To test the console, click the text field below the large white box and enter the GCode command ''M503''.  This should display the configuration settings for the Robox.  It's a good idea to take a copy of these settings for future reference.

For more GCode commands, consult the Robox Manual: the "Supplementary Information" appendix contains a list of GCode commands.  **However, it's important to note that it's very easy to give Robox GCode instructions that may damage it, and so by doing so you may invalidate your warranty.**  If in any doubt, stop what you're doing, switch off Robox and ask on the forums or ask CEL.
