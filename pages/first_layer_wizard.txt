The first layer is one of the most important things to achieving a good quality print.


^ Ref ^ Task ^ Screenshot ^
| 1 | Run "Calibrate Nozzle Opening" which can be found in the "Maintenance" tab when clicking on the 3 dots to the right of your "Status" frame - follow on-screen instructions| {{ :wiki:wiki_1.jpg?200 |}} |
| 2 | Run "Calibrate Nozzle Height" which can also be found in the "Maintenance" tab - follow on-screen instructions|  |
| 3 | Load your model as per instructions manual | {{ :wiki:wiki2.jpg?200 |}} |
| 4 | Print using "Draft" mode to check the 0.8mm nozzle  |{{ :wiki:wiki3.jpg?200 |}} |
| 5 | Keep an eye on the print as it progresses, if the nozzle height is set correctly you should see a nice and flat filament extrusion, without any gaps inside the perimeter. |{{ :wiki:wiki4.jpg?200 |}} |
| 6 | Cancel the print after the first few layers, wait for it to cool, remove from the base and inspect the underside. A good first layer is shown opposite. | {{:wiki:wiki5.jpg?200 |}}|
| 7 | If you can see the bed in-between filament paths, your head is set too high. This is also apparent when inspecting the underside by cylindrical beads of filament that aren't fused between paths. | awaiting image |
| 8 | If the head scrapes the bed or very little/no filament is extruded (assuming nozzle are clear) the head is set too low.  | awaiting image |
| 9 | Run "Calibrate Nozzle Opening" again in the maintenance tab, being sure to allow the paper to move freely but still feeling the nozzle light scraping the paper. | awaiting image |
| 10 | Print the model again and inspect the paths on the first layer as above | awaiting image |
| 11 | If the head is still too high or too low, you can manually adjust the nozzles height (not officially suggested but has worked well for myself & at least one other beta backer) | |
| 12 | Select "Calibrate Nozzle Height" in "Maintenance" tab | |
| 13 | Select "Adjust nozzle offsets" | {{ :wiki:wiki6.jpg?200 |}}|

WORK IN PROGRESS!!!
