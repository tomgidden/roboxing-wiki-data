====== STL files ======

STL (originally, STereoLithography) is the primary input format for AutoMaker; the "document" that the Robox prints.  It's a very simplistic 3D file format, and the simplicity leads it to being supported by a wide range of 3D packages and products, to some degree.  It's really a lowest-common-denominator.

==== Getting STL files ====

Most 3D model communities, such as [[Thingiverse]], offer STL files to download.  For more examples, check the [[Things]] article.

==== Making STL files ====

Main article: [[Content creation]]

You can create 3D content and export it to STL files using a range of 3D editor packages, including the freely-available packages [[http://www.blender.org|Blender]], [[http://www.openscad.org|OpenSCAD]], [[http://clara.io|Clara.IO]]; or commercial products such as [[http://rhino3d.com|Rhinoceros 3D]], [[http://www.thefoundry.co.uk/products/modo/|MODO]], or full-featured 3D packages such as Maya, LightWave, [[http://www.autodesk.com/products/3ds-max/overview|3DS Max]].

==== Fixing STL files ====

STL files can often contain faulty geometry that AutoMaker will fail to load or print correctly.  Such problems can be fixed by using a tool like the free applications [[http://meshlab.sourceforge.net|MeshLab]] and [[http://www.cloudcompare.org|CloudCompare]], or the online tool [[http://netfabb.azurewebsites.net|NetFabb]].
