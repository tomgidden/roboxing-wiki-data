Check the thickness of your filament in folowing cases:
- You install new filament
- Filament was exposed for several days to open air
- You had trouble before with this type of filament

Diameter should be 1.75 mm with a 0.05 mm tolerance.
Too thick can cause problems with the bowden tubes as it can get stuck more easily,
and any deviation of 1.75 mm diameter can cause faults in your print with too much
or too less filament being fed to the print head.
Change print parameters accordingly.
