====== Calibrate Nozzle Opening ======

(Also known as //Needle valve calibration//)

From the manual:  This routine is used to calibrate the point at which the needle valves in the head operate. The firmware has to know the point at which the plastic begins to flow in order to accurately control extrusion.

Most 3D printers of Robox's class have an open nozzle and rely on the viscosity of the material to control the deposition of plastic.  This leads to smears and strings of molten plastic being stretched when the head moves.

Robox's head, on the other hand, uses a needle valve at the point of each nozzle.  It can insert a needle into the nozzle itself to block the output of plastic precisely.  This allows greater detail and quality, and also allows Robox to use pressure to prime the head before printing.

This calibration routine is used to set what constitutes "Open" and "Closed".  By asking the user if plastic is coming out of a particular nozzle, it can deduce how high to set the needle valve to allow or block flow.

==== What constitutes "flowing"? ====

When doing this calibration, there can be a situation where a tiny amount of plastic flows but an additional step would release a more normal flow. 

It is better to set it when the tiny amount starts coming out of the nozzle, rather than calibrating for full flow.  Otherwise the nozzle may leak and drip when apparently blocked, and may leave strings of plastic.((Confirmed in person with @Pete  --[[user:gid|@gid]]))

Capturing the instance when the tiniest amount of plastic can be seen flowing out of the nozzle may require you to wait a few seconds after pressing the "No" button indicated in the AutoMaker screen, as it might take a short time before enough plastic flows to be visible.

It may be helpful to do the test twice: the first test would consist of counting how many "No" clicks it takes for plastic to clearly flow, and then a second test to fine tune the calibration, so that you intentionally wait and observe the nozzle for a few seconds after clicking "No" once you get closer to the number of "No" clicks from the first test.




==== Effect ====

This directly affects whether the nozzle outputs plastic or not, and whether the nozzle leaks or not.  It may also affect extruder slippage, if the extruder is pushing against a closed nozzle it thinks is open.  It's not as subtle as other calibration settings that the effect of which may be more difficult to detect.

This routine directly changes the "B" values in the Head configuration panel.  Typically, the [[0.3mm fine nozzle]] setting will have a positive B value around +1.00, whereas the [[0.8mm fill nozzle]] will have a negative B value around -1.00.
