====== Calibrate Nozzle Opening ======

(Also known as //Needle valve calibration//)

From the manual:  This routine is used to calibrate the point at which the needle valves in the head operate. The firmware has to know the point at which the plastic begins to flow in order to accurately control extrusion.

Most 3D printers of Robox's class have an open nozzle and rely on the viscosity of the material to control the deposition of plastic.  This leads to smears and strings of molten plastic being stretched when the head moves.

Robox's head, on the other hand, uses a needle valve at the point of each nozzle.  It can insert a needle into the nozzle itself to block the output of plastic precisely.  This allows greater detail and quality, and also allows Robox to use pressure to prime the head before printing.

This calibration routine is used to set what constitutes "Open" and "Closed".  By asking the user if plastic is coming out of a particular nozzle, it can deduce how high to set the needle valve to allow or block flow.

==== What constitutes "flowing"? ====

When doing this calibration, there can be a situation where a tiny amount of plastic flows but an additional step would release a more normal flow. 

It is better to set it when the tiny amount starts coming out of the nozzle, rather than calibrating for full flow.  Otherwise the nozzle may leak and drip when apparently blocked, and may leave strings of plastic.((Confirmed in person with @Pete  //--[[user:gid|@gid]]//))

Capturing the instance when the tiniest amount of plastic can be seen flowing out of the nozzle may require you to wait a few seconds after pressing the "No" button indicated in the AutoMaker screen, as it might take a short time before plastic flows enough to be visible. 

So for the nozzle opening calibration, when running the click test, it is best to wait for the smallest amount of filament extruded and accept at that point or accept a click before the smallest amount of filament is extruded or after depending on the result you want to achieve and the material you are using, this is discussed further below. 

What is meant by the tiniest amount of plastic is the thinnest layer you can see appearing out of the nozzle when you reach the magic number of clicks (explained below also), this is when the material just starts to flow out of the nozzle, this is not supposed to be a lot of material and could just be a thin film on the nozzle. You need to make sure your nozzle is clean and dry before the test otherwise you may not be able to distinguish it.

You can perform you calibration test in three stages and repeat or shorten as needed:

1-	 The first time you run the test would consist of counting how many "No" clicks it takes for plastic to clearly flow out of the nozzle.

2-	 The second test would consist of counting how many "No" clicks it takes for the tiniest amount of plastic to flow out of the nozzle. Take it slow and wait after every click especially once you get closer to the number of "No" clicks from the first test. This will enable you to clearly see if something is extruded, therefore you should also count how many times it takes to extrude the finest amount of filament; this is your magic number so write it down somewhere. 

3-	Then the third test can be used to fine tune the calibration, basically to see if you can refine it further in case you are off by a click or two or to set the nozzle opening where you want it to be in order get the results you desire based on the material you are using. This can only be done by knowing the magic number in order to achieve the settings below:

a.	 Extremely precise- (1 or 2 clicks before fine) ABS works well with this setting but some other material like T-Glase do not do so well in this setting.

b.	Precise- (the magic number of clicks) the amount of clicks it takes to extrude the smallest amount or material. This can be seen as the standard Robox setting which the calibration steps lead the user to.

c.	Oozy (a few clicks after fine) â€“ some materials may need this kind of setting if they have issues with flowability. Based on the forum this is the case for materials such as BronzeFill.

==== Effect ====

This directly affects whether the nozzle outputs plastic or not, and whether the nozzle leaks or not.  It may also affect extruder slippage, if the extruder is pushing against a closed nozzle it thinks is open.  It's not as subtle as other calibration settings that the effect of which may be more difficult to detect.

This routine directly changes the "B" values in the Head configuration panel.  Typically, the [[0.3mm fine nozzle]] setting will have a positive B value around +1.00, whereas the [[0.8mm fill nozzle]] will have a negative B value around -1.00.
