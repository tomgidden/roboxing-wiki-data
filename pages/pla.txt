==== Properties ====
  * Easy to print;  easier than [[ABS]]
  * Does not shrink, so easier to make precision parts.
  * Fair all-rounder;
  * Harder than ABS; Higher tensile strength, but also more brittle and likely to snap.
  * Burns cleanly when fully combusted; useful for casting
  * Bio-degradable to CO₂, water and humus, although not that easily (see datasheet above)
  * Does not dissolve in acetone
  * Temperature range: 180ºC-230ºC depending on brand.
  * Softens at relatively low temperatures (compared to ABS)
  * Hygroscopic: keep sealed with [[Storing filament|dessicants]], eg. silica gel

=== Typical physical properties ===
  * Density: 1.24 g/cm³, ie. ≈ 3 grams/metre (1.75mm filament)
  * Melting point: 145-160ºC
  * Melt temperature: 210±8ºC
==== Availability ====

  * Widely available
  * Also available on officially-supported Robox Reel direct from CEL: [[http://robox.cel-uk.com/filament/pla-filament.html]]

==== Hints and Tips ====
  * [[Storing filament|Keep it dry and sealed when not in use.]]

==== Print profiles and tweaks ====
  * Standard Robox profiles
