====== Welcome to Roboxing.com! ======

This is an unofficial documentation, help, and... heck, fan site for the [[http://www.cel-robox.com/|CEL Robox® 3D Printer]].

It is maintained and edited by Robox users, and is not affiliated with CEL. Oh, and **if something suggested here ends up with a negative result (eg. it voiding your warranty; or your Robox setting itself, you, your belongings, your pets or your house on fire) then it's not our fault.  It's up to you to decide if what you read here is correct, advisable and safe, and act accordingly.  In particular, we don't recommend modification of your Robox without getting approval from CEL first.** Just ask: they're nice.

This site is intended to //complement// CEL's official website, support site, and forums; not replace them.

Anyway, please write and upload stuff!  If you've got an idea, or something cool to show off, or some wisdom that may or may not be obvious, don't be afraid: just jump in and edit.  If you not write English good, don't worry about it: it's the knowledge that matters, and someone else will dig in and help out.  If you can't think of anything, why not dip into the forums and look for hints and tips that others have mentioned, and write them up.


Thanks in advance for your contributions!
