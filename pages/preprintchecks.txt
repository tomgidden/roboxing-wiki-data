This is a pre-print checklist to make sure everything will run smoothly.
If you're not sure, check every point in here and make sure things are done correctly.
If you're sure, check it anyway, printing takes a long time, checking this list doesn't.

If the pre-print checks are done for your robox you can go right to [[first_layer_wizard|First Layer Wizard]]
