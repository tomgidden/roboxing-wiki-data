====== Getting Started ======

This is an unfinished guide of some things you should know before you get started with Robox, as well as some hints and tips along the way.

[[getting_started_wizard_list|Getting Started walkthrough from A to Z]]

==== Essentials ====

   * **DON'T mess with the electricals of the Robox while it's still plugged into the mains.**  While an obvious safety tip, this is actually pretty significant. [[Switch it off first|Here's why]]...

   * **NEVER switch the power off while fans are still running on Robox.** When you're finished using the Robox for the day, **let it cool down in its own time**. Once the temperatures level off and the fans stop, then it's time to switch off at the back. This lets it retract filament or whatever it needs to do to keep things in good condition.  See [[Switching off]]

   * Keep an eye on the head and bed temperatures. There are currently some minor issues that may cause [[switch_it_off_first|overheating of the head]].  This can ruin the head quickly, but it may not become apparent until much later.

   * If it makes bad noises -- and it's fairly intuitive what's a bad noise and what's a good noise -- then **don't push it any further**. For example, if the extruder is slipping -- which is a distinctly bad sound -- that can cause subsequent problems with the head, the [[Bowden tube|tube]] that carries the filament to the head, and other components.

   * **If you have any doubts, stop and post to the forums to ask for help.** If you provide a detailed and complete description of the problem (and the settings you've used) ideally with video, someone more experienced will probably be able to help.

   * When you're finished with the Robox and you know you won't be using it for a while, **unload the filament and put it back in a sealed bag** with dessicant pouches.  The plastics normally used pick up humidity from the air and print quality will suffer. For more information, see "[[Storing filament]]"

   * Keep it clean. Use IPA (isopropyl alcohol; isopropanol) for good results. See "[[cleaning_the_printing_surface|Cleaning the printing surface]]".  A 50/50 or 70/30 mix of IPA and deionised water is common and relatively safe, but some users prefer 99% IPA.  **DO NOT** use other solvents, such as acetone, as they can seriously damage the printer, the [[printing surface]], etc.

   * However, do be careful if you're spraying solvents (diluted or otherwise) near an electrical device, esp. one that reaches temperatures of 250ºC. Additionally, the Robox's power supply is at the top of the case and has ventilation holes that spray or drips could get into.

   * Don't scrape the [[printing surface]] clean with a metal blade:  a hard plastic edge will probably do as well and is less likely to damage the surface.

   * Ideally, wear gloves or similar when loading filament: getting dirt, oil, sweat, etc. into the filament path isn't the best idea.  At least make sure your hands are clean.

   * Don't be too ambitious to start with: while the Robox is a lot more "plug-and-play" than other 3D printers, you still need some experience to pull off a really good print... at least for now, while the Robox is still being developed.  Do simple, easy, fast (small) prints to begin with and get used to it.  Otherwise you'll waste nine hours on a print that will fail right near the end and you'll want to defenestrate the Robox. Resist the urge.
==== Calibration ====

=== Head calibration ===

In theory, these two calibrations only need to be done once, as the settings are stored in the head itself.

    * [[Calibrate Nozzle Opening]]: calibrates the point at which the needle valves in each nozzle are open/closed

    * [[Calibrate Nozzle Height]]: calibrates the required parameters for Robox to be able to detect and set the correct height for each nozzle.

    * [[Calibrate Nozzle Alignment]]: calibrates the relative lateral position of the two nozzles, so the fine and fill nozzle can match their locations on the bed precisely.

=== First-Print Nozzle Height Calibration ===
After you complete the three calibrations above, this calibration step will refine the nozzle settings to make sure you have optimal positioning for the nozzles to get the best first-layer adhesion. 
  - Open the Head tab in the Advanced section of AutoMaker. Write down the Z values for both nozzles.
  - Select a simple print. The Robox™ cube works well or a simple cube or cylinder will be fine, though right-angles work best.
  - Print only the first layer of this print with the Draft profile. You really only need part of the first layer but don't let the second layer start. Cancel the print before the second layer starts. Remove the print from the bed.
  - Repeat the print with the Fine profile, again stopping before the second layer is deposited. Remove the print from the bed.
  - Examine the first layer result. You are looking for two qualities:
      * The extrusion paths expand to meet each other so the first layer is one unbroken sheet of plastic.
      * The nozzle is not rubbing on the first layer enough to create troughs or depressions in the first layer. If there are traces or bubbles of plastic on the nozzle, it is rubbing.
  - Adjust the Z value of the nozzle up or down by .05 increments. If you see gaps between extrusion paths, adjust down. If the nozzle is rubbing, adjust up. Don't forget to write the new values to the head.
  - Repeat until the two qualities above are evident. The ideal first later will be unbroken and will be slightly wavy on a path perpendicular to the path of nozzle travel. For PLA, it is usually better to err slightly low; for PET it is better to err slightly high.

=== Other calibration ===

    * [[Level gantry]], [[Level X]]:  calibrates the overall vertical position of the bed;

    * [[Pre-print height calibration]]:  the four point check done by Robox before every print.

==== What to print ====

    * [[Things]]: models that other users have made;

    * [[Content Creation]]: making your own models to print.
