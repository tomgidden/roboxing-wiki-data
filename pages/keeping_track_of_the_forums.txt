====== Keeping track of the forums ======

Keeping up-to-date on posts on the official forums can be tricky.

While the website does offer RSS feeds, they're tricky to find.  Instead, Roboxing proxies them through FeedBurner for convenience:

===== Reader Software =====

As RSS is less popular than it used to be, software is a little harder to find.  Google Reader has been discontinued.

[[http://feedly.com|Feedly]] is a good cross-platform aggregator, and they maintain a [[http://feedly.com/apps.html|comprehensive list of RSS apps]] you might try.
