====== @gid's page ======

I set up and run this site, but I definitely see it as //our// site, not mine.  The content is all licenced with Creative Commons, freely usable (with attribution), and owned collectively by the users.

Meanwhile, I'm mainly using my Robox for trying things out and making useful widgets for my own use.  I publish things on [[http://www.thingiverse.com/_gid/about|Thingiverse]]; I'm relatively active in the forums; and I'm happy to help other users out.  I'm fortunate to live less than a mile from CEL's offices, so I have been known to pop in and say Hi.  However, opinions are my own, and don't take anything I have to say as "insider knowledge" in any sense!
