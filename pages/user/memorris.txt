Had my Robox for about two weeks now and only last night produced first successful print of the pyramid.  Seem to be a lot of problems: B-axis stuck; will not eject filament or will not purge properly and always when starting the app I get the windows 'Do you want to allow this program to make changes...'  So a bit disappointed at the mo.

B-axis error always happens after the head light goes out at the beginning of the layer about to be printed.
