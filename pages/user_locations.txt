====== User locations ======

<function=usermap>

To add yourself to this map, create yourself a user page and add details of your Robox to it.  To create a user page, add yourself to the list of users below using the same syntax.  Click the link and Create Page, and then add details of your printer, including the latitude and longitude.  For example:

<code>
==== Robox details ====
  * Name: gidBOT; The Destroyer of Heads
  * Location: 51.490N, 2.764W (Portishead, North Somerset, UK)
  * Model: Beta, green; obtained from another backer during Beta
  * Head: #53, Rev. 4?
  * Nozzle Heights: 0.55, 0.80 (Extremely variable, though)
  * Platform: OS X 10.10 Yosemite DP7
</code>

You can also use your user page for posting examples of your prints; thoughts; and just about anything else (relevant).  Anyway, if your page contains a line like //%%Location: 12.34N, 56.78E%%//, your page will get added to the map.
