====== User locations ======

<function=usermap>

To add yourself to this map, create yourself a user page and add details of your Robox to it.  To create a user page, add yourself to the list of users below using the same syntax.  Click the link and Create Page, and then add a section with details of your printer, including the latitude and longitude.  For example:

<code>
==== Robox details ====
  * Robox Name: MyBOX
  * Location: 51.490N, 2.764W (Portishead, North Somerset, UK)
  * Model: Kickstarter Early Bird, green
  * Head: #53, Rev. 4?
  * Nozzle Heights: 0.55, 0.80
  * Platform: Windows 8
</code>

You can also use your user page for posting examples of your prints; thoughts; and just about anything else (relevant).  Anyway, if your page contains a line like //%%Location: 12.34N, 56.78E%%//, your page will get added to the map. You're encouraged to include any other relevant information, such as your OS, any configuration settings or tweaks you've made.

If you don't have a Robox yet but you still want to be on the map, no problem!  Just add yourself in the same way as above and just put something about not having one yet.  You'll be displayed on the map in the same way.
