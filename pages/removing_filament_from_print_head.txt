  * If you heat up a needle and carefully push it into the center of the filament (not too deep). Let the needle cool for a minute or two then it may pull out.  -- {{http://www.cel-robox.com/forums/topic/material-ejection-failure-and-more/#post-6408}}

This is used in conjunction with the "[[Manual Purge]]" operation.
