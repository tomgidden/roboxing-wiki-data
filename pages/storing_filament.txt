====== Storing filament ======

Many types of plastic filament used by [[wp>fused filament fabrication|FFF/FDM]] printers such as Robox are [[wp>hygroscopic]]: they absorb water from the air if left unwrapped.

This water can adversely affect print quality, as it can boil during the print process, bubbles bursting and spoiling the print surface. //(picture needed)//

To counter this, filament should be stored in airtight containers when not in use, ideally with silica gel packets or other desiccants -- materials that will absorb humidity more readily than the filament.

However, desiccants aren't infinitely usable: as they absorb water they become less and less effective.  Some can be "recharged" by baking or leaving on a low heat source such as a radiator.  Some silica gel products will change colour (typically blue or orange) when saturated.

==== Recovering "damp" filament ====

If a spool of filament is already showing signs of moisture uptake, it can be dried out.  This can be done in various ways.  For more information, refer to "[[Recovering damp filament]]".

==== Storage regime ====

== When should I store filament rather than keeping it on Robox? ==
//(to be added... how long is too long?)//
    * From the manual (§4.3, p. 48): "It is therefore essential to store your filament somewhere very dry when your Robox® is not in use for any extended period of time. [...] We recommend returning your filament to its bag after each print to ensure it stays print fresh!"

== What should I do if I use Robox every day? ==
//(to be added... should reels be ejected at the end of each day and stored?)//

Chris E. from CEL "If you are disciplined and remove reel form the printer each day and store it in provided plastic bag with silica gel then doesn't matter how many reels you have"

==== Desiccants and storage ====
   * [[wp>Silica gel]] : the small papery sealed pouches of beads that are often included with new consumer electronics. However, these are inadequate for continued use once the main container is opened. Instead, buy larger quantities (eg. 1kg) for best results. Silica gel optionally includes an indicator additive that changes colour when the beads are saturated: often they can be reconditioned by baking at low heat until the colour reverts.

   * [[wp>Bentonite]] : commonly used as cat litter (although there are other types of cat litter that won't work as well).  Similarly, this can often be reconditioned by heating.  While natural (unlike silica gel), it is a less effective desiccant, and produces dust that may clog or affect the quality of 3D printing.

   * Uncooked rice may also be used as a cheap and plentiful desiccant, although the effectiveness is not clear. Table salt also has desiccant effects, as does non-dairy creamer.

   * ...?

   * Modularised desiccant units.  Eva-Dry 333-style units are cheap and easy-to-use: [[https://www.eva-dry.com/dehumidifiers/eva-dry-333-mini-dehumidifier/|Eva-Dry 333]].  They contain normal colour-change silica gel, but include built-in "recharger" heaters, and are conveniently packaged.
 
   * Electrical dehumidifiers (using a coolant loop): //how well do these work in a confined space, eg. filament storage box?//

   * Airtight boxes

   * Zip-lock / sealable bags

   * Electronic hygrometers: very cheap (£2, €3, $4) on eBay and other sources; [[http://www.google.com/search?q=hygrometer+lcd&tbm=shop|Google Shopping search]]. Small battery-powered units with LCD readouts that can be easily included in a storage bag.  They will often fail to read below 10% for example, but that can still be useful enough to see when desiccant has failed, or alternatively indicate when a desiccant has successfully dried out a bag (and by extension, the contained filament, albeit with a longer delay)
