====== Storing filament ======

Many types of plastic filament used by [[wp>fused filament fabrication|FFF/FDM]] printers such as Robox are [[wp>hygroscopic]]: they absorb water from the air if left unwrapped.

This water can adversely affect print quality, as it can boil during the print process, bubbles bursting and spoiling the print surface.

To counter this, filament should be stored in airtight containers when not in use, ideally with silica gel packets or other desiccants -- materials that will absorb humidity more readily than the filament.

==== Desiccants ====
   * [[wp>Silica gel]] : the small papery sealed pouches that are often included with new consumer electronics
   * [[wp>Bentonite]] : commonly used as cat litter (although there are other types of cat litter that won't work as well)
   * Rice?
   * ...?
   * Electrical dehumidifier : //how well do these work in a confined space, eg. filament storage box?//

However, desiccants aren't infinitely usable: as they absorb water they become less and less effective.  Some can be "recharged" by baking or leaving on a low heat source such as a radiator.  Some silica gel products will change colour (typically blue) when used up.

==== Recovering "wet" filament ====

If a spool of filament is already showing signs of moisture, it can be dried out.

//(to be added.. notes about storing with lots of desiccant; use of oven, after checking that Robox SmartReels can cope with that)//
