The manual recommended cutting the filament at an angle of around 45°, but now there is an updated recommendation from CEL:

//Cut the end of the filament so the end is approximately square. We previously advised to cut filament at an angle 45° or less. We now advise a square cut on the end to avoid piercing the Bowden tube//

So here is the procedure to change filament:

1. Read the manual.

2. Eject the current filament by clicking the eject button in AutoMaker or pressing the eject button in the middle of the reel for more than 3 seconds.

3. Clip the end of the new material at a square angle.

4. Feed the new material into the Robox until the Robox grabs it.

5. Choose a head temperature which is in the middle between the current material and new material.
(If new material is an original Robox reel a wizard will help you after you inserted the new reel)

6. Perform at least one purge.
