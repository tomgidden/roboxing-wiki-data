====== GCode ======

As with most [[wp>fused filament fabrication|FFF/FDM]] 3D printers, AutoMaker uses [[wp>GCode]] to communicate with Robox.  This is a simple language containing relatively low-level instructions to the printer firmware.

AutoMaker generates the GCode by passing the model to [[Slic3r]] which generates the required GCode.  AutoMaker then post-processes the GCode to add in extra instructions to handle Robox-specific capabilities not yet supported by Slic3r.

The two GCode files are stored in the ''CEL\PrintJobs'' directory:  each print job has a subdirectory with a (currently) random name.  To find the relevant print job, list the directory by 'Date Modified' or 'Date Added'.  Inside you'll find several files including the relevant profiles used; the original [[STL]] file(s); and the original and post-processed ''gcode'' files.

==== Viewing GCode ====

GCode can be edited manually, although with varying results and an element of risk. This is certainly an advanced topic.

However, it can also be visualised using several tools:

    * GCode Viewer http://gcode.ws/ - An online 2D/3D visualiser;

    * Repetier-Host http://www.repetier.com - Part of a larger package, but the app can be used for visualisation;

    * Pleasant3D http://www.pleasantsoftware.com/developer/pleasant3d/ - A simple package for Mac

By visualising the model and the way Robox intends to print it, you can identify problem spots and change design or settings accordingly.

==== Sharing GCode ====

//(To be added... apparently, GCode can be shared between users.  I'm not sure if this is original or post-processed GCode, or how Robox/AutoMaker will handle it.  It brings up the possibility of using a different slicer.  More experimentation needed.  --[[user:gid|@gid]])//
